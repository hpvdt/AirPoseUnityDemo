 
# Environment
- This is a Unity 2022.3 project
- The path of the Unity command-line tool is OS-dependent:
  - `C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2022.3.62f1\Editor\Unity.exe` on Windows
  - `~/Unity/Hub/Editor/2022.3.62f1/Editor/Unity` on Linux
- The project can be built with `dotnet build <Project Name>.sln`
- Unit and integration tests should use `Tests` directory under asset or package as the root directory
- The suffix of each Test Suite class is `Spec` 

# Rules
- avoid using GUID in asmdef files
- avoid using non-nullable field in public struct, null safety cannot be guaranteed by C# 9 compiler
- build with dotnet to figure out build errors
- compile the project often to verify your work
- any field or variable annotated with `[Required]` cannot be null, do not check if they are null
- when executing unit tests or integration tests, use batch mode count the number of tests executed and the number of tests passed

# Global rules
- make sure each edit is minimal, avoid syntax-only change
- avoid writing redundant or short comment
- do not delete existing comment

# Rules
- avoid using GUID in asmdef files
- build with dotnet to figure out build errors
- compile the project often to verify your work
- any field or variable annotated with `[Required]` cannot be null, do not check if they are null
- make sure each edit is minimal, avoid syntax-only change
- do not delete existing comment
- when executing unit tests or integration tests, use batch mode count the number of tests executed and the number of tests passed
